1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,040
Looks like a doll's house.

2
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,840
It is a bit like a doll's house.

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,000
This is loose,
so you can get underneath this.

4
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,280
-This is 5'9".
-JAGGER: Why?

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,680
So the back-line guys can get in
and out of there.

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,960
Look at those balconies.

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,160
It might be nice to get them
out there, from... One wide.

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,480
You know what I mean, Bob?
Hand-held.

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,440
RICHARDSON: Well, that we can do.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,720
I don't know.

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,080
I have no idea why
the stage is designed in this way.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,480
lf there's any really rhyme
or reason to it.

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,760
-Which part?
-All of it.

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,400
-You wanted it.
-I never asked for those.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,000
That's Marty that wanted all of those.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,480
I thought he wanted those.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
So we got them now.
I hope he likes them.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,120
(SINGING UNDER MY THUMB)

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,960
I don't know what's going on.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,480
I did a hundred things overthere,
but nothing that I needed to do.
