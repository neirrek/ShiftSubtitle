ShiftSubtitle
=============

ShiftSubtitle is a Ruby command line script for shifting SRT subtitles of a
given amount of time.

This script is my personal solution to the first Ruby Programming Challenge
For Newbies (RPCFN) launched by LearningRuby.com on Sept. 24, 2009.

See [RPCFN: Shift Subtitle (#1)](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/09/24/rpcfn-shift-subtitle-1/) for more details.
